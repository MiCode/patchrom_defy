<p><b>Automatic software install</b></p>
<span class="style1">The default USB Mode(Mass Storage) for Verizon phones contains a mass storage device as well as a CDROM partition that auto launches software installation from the phone onto a host computer. Some car stereos and photo kiosks do not support the CDROM partition being present and may not work.</span>
<span class="style1">To resolve this, we have created this option which will allow a non-persistent change so that the next time you connect the device, the CDROM partition will be removed, and allow the car stereo or photo kiosk to see your device's mass storage.</span>
<p><b>How to use:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your mobile is set to Mass Storage mode. This is the default selection, so if you never changed it before, it should be set to that now. If you want to check what it is set to, connect the device to USB and then in the notification pull down select USB connection and then ensure that Mass Storage is selected.</li><br>
<li>Disconnect from USB.</li><br>
<li>Go to Menu-Storage-Disable SW Auto Install and select it.</li><br>
<li>Connect your device to the car stereo or photo kiosk.</li><br>
</ul>
<span class="style1">Every time you want to use this option, you have to go into the menu and select it BEFORE you connect USB.</span>
